Frequently, missing links (or wrongly defined links) restrict the transport of energy/mass. If you are certain that all links are set correctly, it is most likely a bug in EnergyModelsGeography and should be reported.\nIf you observe no transfer of mass between geographical regions, please check first that you use a GeoAvailability node as the description is different from a GenAvailability node. In addition, please check that the Transmission corridors and TransmissionModes are set correctly as well as there is a demand or suppy in both areas of the transported Resource.\nIf the problem occurs in model construction, it is most likely a bug in either EnergyModelsBase or EnergyModelsGeography and should be reported in the respective package. The error message of Julia should provide you with the failing function and whether the failing function is located in EnergyModelsBase or EnergyModelsGeography. It can occur, that the last shown failing function is within JuMP or MathOptInterface. In this case, it is best to trace the error to the last called EnergyModelsBase or EnergyModelsGeography function.\nIf the problem is only appearing for specific solvers, it is most likely not a bug in EnergyModelsGeography, but instead a problem of the solver wrapper for MathOptInterface. In this case, please contact the developers of the corresponding solver wrapper.\nLabel the issue as bug, and\nProvide a minimum working example of a case in which the bug occurs.\n\nnote: Note\nWe are aware that certain design choices within EnergyModelsGeography can lead to method ambiguities.

TransmissionModes includes capacity limits (trans_cap), losses (trans_loss) and directions (directions) for the generic transmission modes RefDynamic and RefStatic. More specialized TransmissionModes such as subtypes of the abstract type PipeMode can convert one inlet resource to another outlet resource. This approach can be used for representing a static pressure drop within a pipeline. The PipeMode can be consuming another resource such as electricity for compressors at a consumption_rate in order to transport natural gas or hydrogen. The consumption_rate is in this situation proportional to the transport of the inlet resource. All TransmissionModes can also include both fixed (opex_fixed) and variable (opex_var) operational expenditures (OPEX).\n\nwarning: Warning\nAll parameters of the implemented TransmissionModes are relative (based on usage, opex_var and trans_loss, or the installed capacity, opex_fixed). They are independent of the distance. The reasoning for this approach is that it allows the modeller to have a non-linear, distance dependent OPEX or loss function for providing the input to the model.","category":"section"},{"location":"library/public/mode/#lib-pub-mode-types","page":"TransmissionMode","title":"TransmissionMode types","text":"The following TransmissionModes are implemented and exported:","category":"section"},{"location":"library/public/mode/#lib-pub-mode-fun_fields","page":"TransmissionMode","title":"Functions for accessing fields of TransmissionMode types","text":"The following functions are defined and exported for accessing fields from a TransmissionMode:","category":"section"},{"location":"library/public/mode/#EnergyModelsGeography.TransmissionMode","page":"TransmissionMode","title":"EnergyModelsGeography.TransmissionMode","text":"abstract type TransmissionMode\n\nDeclaration of the general type for transmission modes transporting resources between areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"library/public/mode/#EnergyModelsGeography.RefStatic","page":"TransmissionMode","title":"EnergyModelsGeography.RefStatic","text":"struct RefStatic <: TransmissionMode\n\nA reference static TransmissionMode.\n\nGeneric representation of static transmission modes, such as overhead power lines or pipelines.\n\nFields\n\nid::String is the name/identifyer of the transmission mode.\nresource::Resource is the resource that is transported.\ntrans_cap::Real is the capacity of the transmission mode.\ntrans_loss::Real is the loss of the transported resource during transmission, modelled as a ratio.\nopex_var::TimeProfile is the variable operating expense per energy unit transported.\nopex_fixed::TimeProfile is the fixed operating expense per installed capacity.\ndirections is the number of directions the resource can be transported, 1 is unidirectional (A->B) or 2 is bidirectional (A<->B).\ndata::Vector{<:ExtensionData} is the additional data (e.g., for investments).

A key aim behind this removal is to avoid having to specify the fields if one does not provide a value to the data or the directions field. This was solved through\n\nan internal constructor only allowing for unidirectional pipelines and\nan external constructor for cases in which the field data is not specified.\n\nBidirectional transport for pipelines was removed as the model did not support it. A key factor here is the consuming resource which is required for pumping or compression energy demand. In the case of bidirectional transport, the consuming resource is consumed in the from region. In the case of reversed flow, this would lead to undesired behavior. Previously, warnings were printed. We consider it to be more consistent with the framework philosophy to remove that potential source of error.\n\ndanger: New subtypes for `PipeMode`\nIt is still possible for the user to provide new PipeModes that provide bidirectional transport. In this case, it is necessary to provide new methods for constraints_capacity and constraints_trans_loss. Otherwise, warnings will be provided and unidirectional transport used.The variable OPEX calculation is wrong if you receive the warnings.\n\nThe translations below describe the keyword constructor.
