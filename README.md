Geography is a package to add a geographic represation to both operational and investment models. It is developed primarily to add this functionality to EnergyModelsBase.jl and InvestmentModels.jl.

This package is currently experimental/proof-of-concept and under heavy development. Expect breaking changes.

## Usage

```julia
using EnergyModelsGeography
```

## Discussion points
* what type of links
* Connection between availability nodes for linking two geographical regions or between technological nodes that correspond to landfall/liquefaction termials
* Possibility to implement multiple scale for a geographical representation?


## Funding

Geography was funded by the Norwegian Research Council in the project Clean Export, project number [308811](https://prosjektbanken.forskningsradet.no/project/FORISS/308811)
