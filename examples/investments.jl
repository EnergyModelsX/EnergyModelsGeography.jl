    generate_example_network_investment()

Generate the data for an example consisting of a simple electricity and CO₂ network. It is
loosely adapted from the `network.jl` example of `EnergyModelsBase`:
https://github.com/EnergyModelsX/EnergyModelsBase.jl/blob/main/examples/network.jl

The example consists of two areas, a coal area with a coal power plant, a flat electricity
demand, and a CO₂ storage site, and a natural gas area with a natural gas power plant with
CCS and a variable electricity demand. The latter has lower deficit costs if insufficient
electricity is delivered.

There is initially no transmission capacity between the two areas, neither for electricity
nor for CO₂. As a consequence, exchange of energy or mass requires investing in transmission
capacity.
