# [Quick Start](@id man-quick)

> 1. Install the most recent version of [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/)
> 2. Install the package [`EnergyModelsBase`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsBase.jl/) and the time package [`TimeStruct`](https://sintefore.github.io/TimeStruct.jl/), by running:
>
>    ```julia
>    ] add TimeStruct
>    ] add EnergyModelsBase
>    ```
>
>    These packages are required as we do not only use them internally, but also for building a model.
> 3. Install the package [`EnergyModelsGeography`](https://energymodelsx.github.io/EnergyModelsGeography.jl/)
>
>    ```julia
>    ] add EnergyModelsGeography
>    ```
